No transformations happen at the input layer, it's just where the inputs are added. In each of the nodes of a hidden layer, a linear transformation will take place, as well as a transformation because of an activation function. \n",

    "## Forward Propagation\n",
    "\n",
    "Obtaining the expression for the cost function and the loss function is called forward propagation. The cost function takes a convex form. The idea is that we start with some initial values of w abd b and then graident descent takes a step in the steepest direction downhill. Taking the derivatives to calculate the difference between the desired and calcualted outcome, repeating these steps until you get the lowest possible cost value, is called backpropagation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural Networks work like this: We perform the dot product for input data set with the weight set. We feed z into an activation function, f(z) so that we get an output for the hidden layer's first neuron. F() need not be a step function. We repeat this with the same input data and weights to the second hidden neuron, and then we will get the output for the second hidden neuron in another hidden layer. We repeat these steps until the last weight using input data from the nth instance. Now the hidden layer outputs are calcualted, and used as inputs to calculate the final output. For the final output, perform a dot product for hidden layer outputs, which we now consider as inputs, and hidden layer weights. Remember that the inputs are hidden layer outputs. Since we only have 1 output, our set of weights consists of a range with n weights, since we have n hidden layer inputs. Then we add the sum of the dot product with bias to obtain a result z. We feed z into an activation function f(z) so that we get an output for the output layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the activation function is linar, then you can stack as many hidden layers in the neural network as you wish, and the final output is still a linear combination of the original input data. Here, a small change in any weight in the input layer of our perceptron network could possibly lead to one neuron to suddenly flip from 0 to 1, which could again affect the hidden layer's behavior and then affect the final outcome; with a step function as an activation function. The sigmoid neuron, which comes with the sigmoid function is another activation function. The sigmoid function produces similar results to step function in that the output is between 0 and 1; the curve is smooth, and has a nice and simple derivative, which is differentiable everywhere on the curve. Sigmoid introduces non-linearity into our neural network model. The output layer of a neural node represents a combinatorial charge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks become better by repetitively training themselves on data so they can adjust each layer of the network to get the final results/actual output closer to the desired output. So when we actually train this neural network with al the training examples, we don't know what weights we should assign to each of the layers. So we just randomly ask the computer to assign weights in each layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of randomly initializing weights is important because each time you train a deep learning neural network, you are initializing different numbers to the weights. So, essentially, you are initializing different numbers to the weights and you have no clue what's going on in the network until after the network is trained. A trained neural network has weights which are optimized at certain values that make the best prediction or classification of our problem. It's a black box, and each time the network will have different sets o weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "In multi layer neural networks, the first hidden layer will be able to learn some very simple patterns. Each additional hidden layer will somehow be able to learn progressively more complicated patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "In forward propagation, you get x and you compute y_hat; after, you calculate the cost function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is how forward propagation is performed/calculated: Z1 is the output of the linear transformation of the initial input, A1 (the observations). In successive layers, A1 is the output from the previous hidden layer. In all of these cases, W1 is a matrix of weights to be optimized to minimize the cost function. B1 is also optimized but is a vector as opposed to a matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "G1 is the activation function which takes the outut of this linear transformation and yields the input to the next hidden layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Backward Propagation\n",
    "\n",
    "Once an output for the NN given the current parameter weights has been calculated, we must back propagate to calculate the gradients of layer paramters with respect to the cost function. This will allow us to apply an optimization algorithm such as gradient descent in order to make small adjustments to the parameters in order to minimize our cost (and improve our predictions).\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize the process once more, we begin by defining a model architecture which includes the number of hidden layers, activation functions, and the number of units in each of these. When we initialize parameters for each of these layers (typically randomly). After the initial parameters are set, forward propagation evaluates the model given a prediction, which is then used to evaluate a cost function. Forward propagation involves evaluating each layer and then piping this output into the next layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each layer consists of a linear transformation and an activation function. The paramters for the linear transformation in each layer include W1 and B1. The output of this linear transfromation is represented by Z1. This is then fed through the activation function (again, for each layer) giving us an output A which is the input for the next layer of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "After forward propagation is completed and the cost function is evaluated, back propagation is used to calculate gradients of the initial paramters with respect to this cost function. Finally, these gradients are then used to optimize the algorithm, such as gradient descent, to make small adjustments to the parameters and the entire process of forward propagation, back propagation, and parameter adjustments is repeated until the modeller is satisfied with the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use batches because if we were to push all of our samples through at once, we would have to wait until everyhthing is processed and can only start backpropagating then. Therefore, batches are used, so that after each batch has done a forward propagation step, backward prop can happen again. In essence, it's 'mini-batch' gradient descent. A batch generally approximates the distribution of the input data better than a single output. The larger the batch, the better the approximation. However, it is also true that the batch will take longer to process and will result in only one update. For inference (to evaluate, or predict) it is recommended to pick a batch size that is as large as you can afford without going out of memory. Epochs are an arbitrary cutoff, generally defined as one pass over the entire dataset, used to separate training into distinct phases, which is useful for logging and periodic evaluation. When using valudation_data or validation_split, with the .fit() method of Keras, evaluation will be run at the end of every epoch. Within Keras, there is the ability to add callbacks specifically designed to be run at the end of the epoch. Examples of these are learning rate changes and model checkpointing (saving).\n",
    "\n",
    "Samples in a neural network are one element of the dataset. ex. an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "history.history will return a dictionary of the metrics we indicated when compiling the model. By default, the loss criteria will always be included as well. This dictionary will have two keys, one for the loss and one for the accuracy. If you want to plot learning curves for the loss or accuracy versus the epochs, you can then simply retrieve these lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Making predictions from a trained model is straightforward. y_hat = model.predict(x).\n",

    "## Tuning Neural Networks with Normalization\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to speed up training of your neural networks is to normalize the input. In fact, even if training time were not a concern, normalization to a consistent scale (0 to 1) across features should be used to ensure that the process converges to a stable solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not only will normalizing your inputs speed up training, it can also mitigate other risks inherent in training neural networks. Ex. having input of various ranges can lead to difficult numerical problems when the algorithm goes to compute gradients during forward and back propagation. This can lead to untenable solutions and will prevent the algorithm from converging to a solution. Activation will explode when there are many layers in the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aside from normalizing the data, you can also investigate the impact of changing the initialization parameters when you first launch the gradient descent algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, you could even use an alternative convergence algorithm instead of gradient descent. One issue with gradient descent is that it oscillates to a fairly big extent, because the derivative is bigger in the vertical direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gradient Decent with Momentum\n",
    "\n",
    "Compute an exponentially weighted average of the gradients and use that gradient instead. The intuitive interpretation is that this will successively dampen oscillations improving convergence. Generally, B = 0.9 is a good hyperparameter value.\n",
    "\n",
    "## RMSProp\n",
    "\n",
    "RMSProp stands for 'root mean square' prop. It slows down learning in one direction and speeds up in another one. On each iteration, it uses exponentially weighted average of the squares of the derivatives. In the direction where we want to learn fast, the corresponding S will be small, so dividing by a small number. On the other hand, in the direction where we will want to learn slow, the corresponding S will be relatively large, and updates will be smaller. Often, add small e in the denominator to make sure that you don't end up dividing by 0.\n",
